This is how I felt when I started my PhD:

{% include image.html url= "/assets/trump_meme.png " description="Trump" width="500px"%}

&nbsp;

But, anyway, what does Trump have to do with a PhD defence? You are very welcome to find out by yourself by having a look at [the presentation]({{ site.url }}/assets/PhD_defence_Javier_Saez_Gallego.pdf). Tip: there is an extra one around the middle of the presentation, go search for it!
