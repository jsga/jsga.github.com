Hello world, and welcome to my blog!

The main purpose of this blog is to remember the things I've learned during the small projects I take every now and then. Hopefully, this blog will also allow me to share some knowledge with anyone that passes by.

The topics will be varied and will evolve over time.

Welcome, and cheers!
